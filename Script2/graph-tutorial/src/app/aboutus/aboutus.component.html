  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome! We are members of Run Time Terror participating in the 2020 Ohio State Hackathon completing the
    Microsoft challenges. We wished to combine all three challenges into one by creating a tailored virtual
    workspace for both students and organizations. We will be focusing on the viewpoint of a student enrolled
    in courses. This website will be tailored to the organizational needs of a student but could be easily be
    applied to an employee within a business enterprise. First, the user will be asked to log in and authenticate
    their identity based on the requirements set by their organization. In the case of Ohio State Students, this
    will be their Buckeyemail authenticated with Duo Push. Once the user has been authenticated, he will have
    access to three viewpoints. A "Calendar" viewpoint which will encompass all events, appointments, class
    meetings, and assignments in a monthly outlook. This functionality will be shared with instructors and the user's
    personal calander. This allows the user to combine all calendars into one for an overall view of the student's month.
    The user could also access a singular calendar for a course, a singular calendar for the student personal events,
    and an overall calendar for all events. This, in theory, would combine the user's academic schedule with their
    personal calendar allowing for maximum organization. Next, a "Weekly" viewpoint which will show the user all events
    scheduled in their calendar for the next seven days given the date inputted. This would provide a more informational
    viewpoint to the schedule the student has set for that week. Lastly, a "To-Do" viewpoint which will show the user the
    events, assignments, and appointments due on that day. Future plans for this page will include automation of email-sending
    bots which will remind the user of events, appointments, and due dates. This will be based on user preferences and will
    offer options such as "Please remind me of 'X' due date one week prior of the due date, one day prior of the due date,
    and one hour prior of the assigned due date." These time settings for remainders will be completely set by the user,
    furthering the user experience. Currently, this is just an experiment to bring a more friendly user experience to those
    struggling to maintain organizational skills within the Virtual World. Please enjoy what we have created :)!
